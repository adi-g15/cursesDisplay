Testing for creating and controlling multiple terminal screen with curses.

If time permits (before 100DaysOfCode ends), will create this into a class that can be used to do this more easily, and in an encapsulated manner, rather than free functions taking pointers (nothing bad, with that, though i prefer not to pass the safe thing again and again, and that the pointers should relate to the class using it)
